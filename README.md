# sudoku-via-backtracking
A Sudoku solver which find solutions for Sudoku problems (if exist) using backtracking, written in Python. A Bath CS MSc Artificial Intelligence assignment

# How to use?
You can read the code in "ai4_sudoku.ipynb" in github 
Or
1) Installing Python and Jupyter using the conda package manager. The miniconda distribution includes a minimal Python and conda installation.
2) Use the Jupyter application to open the file "ai4_sudoku.ipynb". Click the "Cell" tab and then Run all the cells 

The ipynb file contains all the information regarding the assignment.
Cell 2 contains the code which implements backtracking
Cell 3 shows the results of sample sudoku problems solved by the sudoku solver code. 

# What I learnt?
- implementation of backtracking algorithm to solve constraint satifaction problem (Sudoku)
